## 3. The Workflows

### 3.1 Mapping Workbench
The **Mapping Workbench** is where raw data meets structure. This is usually the first screen you see after selecting an entity.

**Steps to use:**
1.  **Import Data:** Click the **"Import Trial Balance"** button (top right) to upload your CSV file.
2.  **Review Mappings:** The system will display your ledgers.
    - **Mapped Items:** Appear in the main list with their assigned Major/Minor heads.
    - **Unmapped Items:** Will be flagged. Use the dropdowns to assign the correct classification.
3.  **AI Suggestions:** Look for the "AI" icon next to unmapped items to get instantaneous classification suggestions valid under Schedule III.

**Steps to use:**
1.  Click **"Schedules"** in the left navigation sidebar.
2.  Select a specific schedule from the list (e.g., *"Corporate Information", "Share Capital"*).
3.  **Enter Details:** Fill in the required text fields.
    - *Example:* Enter the "Name of the Company", "CIN", or specific "Director Details".
    - **Yellow Fields:** These are read-only and pull values directly from your Mapping.
4.  Click **Save** at the bottom of the form to persist your changes.
