Overview  
This
 
document
 
presents
 
our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
process
 
used
 
for
 
managing
 
ﬁnancial
 
statements
 
and
 
the
 
challenges
 
associated
 
with
 
it.
 
It
 
outlines
 
the
 
key
 
constraints
 
and
 
proposes
 
possible
 
solution
 
approaches
 
aimed
 
at
 
improving
 
accuracy,
 
accountability,
 
and
 
operational
 
eﬃciency.
 
The
 
objective
 
of
 
this
 
document
 
is
 
to
 
ensure
 
alignment
 
with
 
the
 
client
 
before
 
proceeding
 
with
 
the
 
proposed
 
solution.
 
Problem  Statement:  
Based
 
on
 
the
 
discussions
 
and
 
information
 
provided,
 
the
 
problem
 
can
 
be
 
summarized
 
as
 
follows:
 
●
 
Financial
 
statements
 
are
 
currently
 
managed
 
using
 
Excel
 
sheets
 
with
 
manual
 
ﬁle-sharing
 
mechanisms.
 
●
 
The
 
existing
 
process
 
lacks
 
built-in
 
validation
 
checks
 
and
 
standardized
 
control
 
mechanisms.
 
●
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
automated
 
or
 
systematic
 
validation
 
to
 
ensure
 
compliance
 
with
 
Schedule
 
III
 
requirements.
 
●
 
Manual
 
handling
 
of
 
ﬁnancial
 
data
 
increases
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
data
 
entry
 
errors
 
and
 
inconsistencies.
 
●
 
Multiple
 
users
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
ﬁles
 
make
 
version
 
control
 
and
 
change
 
tracking
 
diﬃcult.
 
●
 
Errors
 
are
 
challenging
 
to
 
identify,
 
trace,
 
and
 
resolve
 
eﬃciently.
 
●
 
Senior
 
staﬀ
 
face
 
diﬃculties
 
in
 
reviewing
 
ﬁnancial
 
statements
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
and
 
eﬀective
 
manner.
 
●
 
Accountability
 
is
 
unclear,
 
making
 
it
 
diﬃcult
 
to
 
determine
 
responsibility
 
for
 
errors
 
or
 
modiﬁcations.
 
●
 
Overall,
 
the
 
current
 
process
 
is
 
time-consuming,
 
error-prone,
 
and
 
operationally
 
ineﬃcient.
 
Objectives:  
Based
 
on
 
our
 
understanding,
 
the
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
solution
 
are
 
to:
 
●
 
Streamline
 
the
 
preparation
 
and
 
management
 
of
 
ﬁnancial
 
statements.
 
●
 
Reduce
 
manual
 
eﬀort
 
and
 
reliance
 
on
 
Excel-based
 
workﬂows.

●
 
Minimize
 
errors
 
through
 
structured
 
validations
 
and
 
automated
 
checks.
 
●
 
Ensure
 
full
 
compliance
 
with
 
Schedule
 
III
 
requirements.
 
●
 
Improve
 
visibility
 
and
 
traceability
 
of
 
changes
 
made
 
to
 
ﬁnancial
 
data.
 
●
 
Enable
 
eﬃcient
 
review
 
and
 
issue
 
identiﬁcation
 
by
 
senior
 
staﬀ.
 
●
 
Establish
 
clear
 
accountability
 
for
 
data
 
entry
 
and
 
modiﬁcations.
 
●
 
Enhance
 
the
 
overall
 
eﬃciency,
 
accuracy,
 
and
 
reliability
 
of
 
ﬁnancial
 
reporting.

If

●
 
The
 
sum
 
of
 
the

the
 
sum
 
of

column.

must
 
adhere

●
 
A

Part
