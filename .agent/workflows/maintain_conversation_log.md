# Conversation Logging Workflow

**Goal**: Ensure that `conversation.md` exists and contains a verbatim record of every user input provided during the session.

## Steps

1.  **Check for Existence**: At the start of any new project or major task, check if `conversation.md` exists in the root directory.
2.  **Create if Missing**: If it does not exist, create it with the header `# User Inputs Record`.
3.  **Log Input**:
    *   For every significant user prompt or instruction, append it to `conversation.md` as a list item.
    *   **CRITICAL**: Store the input **word-by-word**, exactly as provided by the user. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or correct typos.
4.  **Updates**: Continuedly append new inputs to the bottom of the list throughout the session.

## Example Format

```markdown
# User Inputs Record

- We had updated the masters extensively yesterday, pls check if they had also been reset...
- It is affecting not only AR AP inpur sheet...
- Create a document conversation.md and start sotring/entering every input...
```
